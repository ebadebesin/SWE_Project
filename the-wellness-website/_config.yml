  The Huston Tillotson University counselling services currently have an in-person office that has limited to no 
  resources online. Most of the time, students prefer to refer to online resources when they are going through 
  unwell times or struggling with their mental Health. The students rarely go to the counseling services or if 
  they go, there is not likely a follow-up on the student's part, or they do not have access to follow-up 
  resources to aid in getting better. However, in the modern-day where technology has overtaken almost all fields,
  this system of only in-person meet ups is most times inefficient. The developer's approach would provide a 
  better, secure, and more user-friendly way to access information concerning counselling services, mental 
  health, and other parts of wellness.
